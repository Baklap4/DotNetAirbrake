Airbrake Notifier for ASP.NET MVC 6

AppVeyor 
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ulhdnsd8r4qvge6p?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ErwinSteffens/dotnetairbrake)

## Why

At my current job I was living between Ruby developers which used Airbrake to monitor application errors. We wanted a single solution for error handling so decided to integrate this in .net MVC 6.

NOTE: We use this with [errbit](https://github.com/errbit/errbit) and have not tested with [Airbrake](https://airbrake.io/) self.

## Usage


## TODO

- [ ] Add tests!
